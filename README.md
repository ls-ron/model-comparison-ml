# model-comparison-ml

This is a mini-project from UoA.
<br>
<br>
In this project we are required to benchmark the Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost ensembling methods using pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
<br>
We use the breast cancer dataset offered by sklearn to achieve this benchmark.
<br>
We evaluate the differences in the machine learning ensemble methods using AUC/Accuracy and classification reports.
